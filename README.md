# ðŸ§  Neuverra Revenue Forecasting (AI Use Case)

This project showcases a multivariate revenue forecasting model using data from *Neuverra*, an industrial robotics and SaaS company. It demonstrates how tools like Microsoft Azure and Python can go far beyond traditional spreadsheet forecasting.

In the past, revenue trends were explained reactively - citing interest rates, market shifts, or seasonality. This project applies predictive modeling to surface patterns **before** results are finalized.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **AI Regression Forecasting** using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio
- **Multivariate dataset** built from Invoices, Orders, Customers, Returns, Campaigns  
- **Data cleaning + joining** done via SQL in PostgreSQL  
- **8+ Python visualizations** created with Seaborn and matplotlib (including regression lines and correlation matrix)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Summary

- **Joined Tables**: Orders, Returns, Customers, Campaigns  
- **Final Table**: `neuverra_monthly_summary.csv`  
- **Notebook Tool**: Azure ML Notebooks  
- **Language**: Python 3.10 (seaborn, pandas, matplotlib)

## ðŸ§  Insights for Executive Leadership

- Forecast revenue with deeper insight  
- Correlate campaign activity with sales  
- Spot underperformance early
