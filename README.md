Neuverra Revenue Forecasting (AI Use Case)
This project showcases a multivariate revenue forecasting model using data from Neuverra, an industrial robotics and SaaS company. It was built as part of an AI portfolio to demonstrate how modern tools like Microsoft Azure and Python can go far beyond traditional spreadsheet forecasting.

In the past, revenue trends were often explained reactively - with sales leaders citing interest rates, market softness, or seasonality after a quarter closed. In contrast, this project embraces predictive modeling to uncover patterns, relationships, and signals across multiple data sources - before results are in.

Key Features
ðŸ“ˆ AI Regression Forecasting
Built using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio to model future revenue from a multivariate dataset.

ðŸ§  Multivariate Inputs
Incorporated marketing campaigns, returns, customer industry/region, order types, and product counts - giving the model far more context than a basic invoice ledger.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Notebook
Created a series of insightful Python plots (including scatter plots with regression lines and correlation matrices) to explore trends and explain model behavior.

ðŸ§¹ Data Enrichment + Cleanup
Merged multiple Neuverra tables (Invoices, Orders, Returns, Customers, Campaigns) using SQL and logic to build a clean, usable feature set.

Why It Matters
This project demonstrates how AI tools today allow for prescriptive decision-making - not just descriptive analysis. 

An Executive can:
- Forecast revenue with deeper insight
- Correlate marketing performance with actual sales
- Spot underperforming segments early
- Make data-backed decisions about where to allocate resources
